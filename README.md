# ML_Examples

Trying to make a best fit line for the water levels in San Diego over the past 115 years.

Step 1 - add test data
Step 2 - get y=mx+b working
Step 3 - get a calculation for the mean squared error working 
Step 4 - get something going for gradient descent (?!?) 
Step 5 - update with real data

I don't think I need SigOpt to optimize this one but maybe I can use it?
